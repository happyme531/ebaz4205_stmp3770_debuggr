2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) DATA3_11 direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (DATA3_11) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-2#1 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) ZYNQ_CORE_i/DATA3_11 direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (DATA3_11_OBUF) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on redLED relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>
